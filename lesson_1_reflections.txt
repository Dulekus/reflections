How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It is verry good command, finding a bug is easy task.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would help me because it is important to see whole course of project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual creating a commit is better.
